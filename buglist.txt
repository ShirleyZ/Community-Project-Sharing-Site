// KNOWN BUGS
x: broke
-: workable
~: maybe fixed?
o: fixed

//- search.asp
- If no projects show up, it's still got the js
    from manage.asp
	 
//- editUser.asp
x users can't edit
	 - problem in nav.asp, fixed just upload
	 - retcon it isn't fixed, doesn't work even if 
		correct url is typed in

//- addProjXML.js
x If you click "add" on the manage.asp top bar, 
    the counter doesn't reset itself
x Adding a new field wipes the info you have in 
    your previous fields

//- addProject2.asp
~ Under 'Yoinking imgs from url string', the loop 
    repeats until 10 instead of stopping earlier 
    when it hits project no imgs

//- makeComment.asp/viewProject.asp
o The date being shown isn't the right date. It 
    shows some weird timestamp. I think it's to
    do with how it's being printed.
    Prints the same number, irrelevant to time
  - Needed to insert datePost as a string

//- makeComment.asp
o Check if there's a datePost field in the 
	 UsersPgCommentsTable.
  - There is, though no entry for first two comments
